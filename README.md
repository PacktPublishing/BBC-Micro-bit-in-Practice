This is the code repository for [BBC Micro:bit in Practice](https://www.packtpub.com/product/bbc-microbit-in-practice/9781804610121), published by Packt.

**A hands-on guide for building creative real-life projects with MicroPython and BBC Micro:bit**

## What is this book about?
BBC Micro:bit is a popular microcontroller platform, packed with sensors, in-built speaker, pushbuttons, and LED matrix that can communicate using Radio and Bluetooth, that can be programmed using various programming platforms such as Microsoft MakeCode, Scratch, MicroPython, C++, Rust, and etc. Individuals need to manipulate the low-level hardware components using MicroPython and Micro:bit, while developing their creative projects.
BBC Micro:bit in Practice provides a holistic understanding of BBC Micro:bit platform and Micropython programming. It will help you to gain practical knowledge of designing circuits and writing programs with the help of mini projects.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Essentials of BBC Micro:bit, its hardware specifications, and versions
* In-depth tour of MicroPython for Micro:bit
* Programming built-in and external LEDs and buttons
* Programming external LED based displays, buzzers, and stepper motors
* Detecting gestures with internal sensors such as accelerometer, compass, and magnetometer
* Explore the features of Micro:bit V2

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter04.

The code will look like the following:
```
def square(a):
   b = a**2
   return b
	
def power(a, b):
   return a**b
	
def multiret(a, b):
   a += 1
   b += 1
   return a, b
   
num = square(3)
print(num)

num = power(3, 3)
print(num)

x, y = multiret(3, 5)
print("{0}, {1}".format(x, y))

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for anyone who would like to use the combination of MicroPython and BBC Micro:bit for building exciting real-life projects. Individuals (like engineers, makers, hobbyists, instructors, etc.) working in areas such as embedded systems, electronics, software development, IoT, robotics, teaching, and training will find this book quite useful to build projects. Prior experience with building basic electronic circuits and any programming language but not necessarily MicroPython will be helpful when using this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).
